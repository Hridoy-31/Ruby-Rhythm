## Understanding puts and print in Ruby

- In Ruby, `puts` and `print` are two commonly used methods for outputting information to the console. While they may seem similar at first glance, they have distinct behaviors and are suited for different purposes.

- `puts` stands for "put string" and is primarily used to output strings to the console, followed by a newline character (`\n`).

- One of the defining features of `puts` is that it automatically appends a newline character to the end of the output, ensuring that each subsequent output appears on a new line.

- After printing the output, `puts` returns `nil`, which means it doesn't provide any meaningful value for assignment or further manipulation.

- `print`, on the other hand, is used to output strings to the console without adding a newline character.

- Unlike `puts`, `print` does not automatically add a newline character to the end of the output. This means that subsequent `print` statements will append their output to the same line.

- Consider using `puts` for general-purpose output and `print` for cases where formatting or inline output is important.
